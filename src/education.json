After diving into JvaScript I covered some concepts like: variables, functions, objects and interconnect them with the browser with the DOM. Server based request (CRUD) using HTTP protocols (AJAX, fetch API and promises). I started using the OOP model based programming and ES6 syntax. Learned the principles and basic commands in GIT and at the end basics of React.js concepts like: components (functional and class based components), props and state, react router and other libraries."
